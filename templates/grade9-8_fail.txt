Hello NAME, this is Bryce. I instructed the referee clinic you attended recently.
I wanted to inform you that you have not passed your tests - each test required at least 40/50 to pass. You scored G9_SCORE/50 on your grade 9 test and G8_SCORE/50 on your grade 8 test. I'd like you to take a look at the following questions that you missed:

G9_QUESTIONS

G8_QUESTIONS

NOTES

(if 29 is on your grade 8 list, I essentially don't care that you got it wrong, and I did not count it against your score. That question is extremely ambiguous as to what they mean by "outstretched". Just take note)

Attached are copies of the test questions for your reference.
In order to complete your testing process, you will need to attend an in-person review session with me at a later date -- expect an email regarding it later.
NOTE: this does not necessarily mean you cannot referee younger games in the interim -- you will need to speak with Dave about that.

Let me know if you have any questions!
