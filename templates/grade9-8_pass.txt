Hello NAME, this is Bryce. I instructed the referee clinic you attended recently.
I wanted to inform you that you have passed your tests - each test required at least 40/50 to pass. You scored G9_SCORE/50 on your grade 9 test and G8_SCORE/50 on your grade 8 test. I'd like you to take a look at the following questions that you missed:

G9_QUESTIONS

G8_QUESTIONS

NOTES

(if 29 is on your grade 8 list, I essentially don't care that you got it wrong, and I did not count it against you. That question is extremely ambiguous as to what they mean by "outstretched". Just take note)

Attached are copies of the test questions for your reference.

If you have any questions regarding the questions you missed, or if you want to see if you understand them after review, let me know. An email with further instructions for certifying will be sent soon.
