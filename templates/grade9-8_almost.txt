Hello NAME, this is Bryce. I instructed the referee clinic you attended recently.
I wanted to inform you that you have almost passed your tests - each test required at least 40/50 to pass. You scored G9_SCORE/50 on your grade 9 test and G8_SCORE/50 on your grade 8 test. These scores are close enough that I don't necessarily require a full re-take of the test. I'd like you to take a look at the following questions that you missed:

G9_QUESTIONS

G8_QUESTIONS

NOTES

(if 29 is on your grade 8 list, I essentially don't care that you got it wrong, and I did not count it against your score. That question is extremely ambiguous as to what they mean by "outstretched". Just take note)

Attached are copies of the test questions for your reference.

In order to complete your testing process, you have 2 options:
1) Talk to me in person at our field day or some other time. We will go over the questions and I'll make sure you've got an understanding of them.
2) Email me the correct answer and a short explanation for each question you got wrong. (If you can't quite get all of them, that's alright. As long as it brings you under -11). If you passed one of your tests, you don't necessarily have to worry about those questions (although feel free to ask about them.)
Usually what we do is the first option, and it is much more relaxed then the second one, but I figured if somebody wants to go the extra mile, I'd give the option. 
If you have any questions, let me know!
