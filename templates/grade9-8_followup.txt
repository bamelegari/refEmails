Hello Referee!
If you're receiving this email, it means the testing portion of your referee certification is complete.

The next step is to create an account, register and pay your fees on Alaska's GameOfficials site. 

GameOfficials is the website that Alaska and much of the country uses to organize, educate, and often (although not here in Fairbanks) assign referees. It is required that you follow these steps in order to become a USSF certified referee.

1) Create a GO account at alaska.gameofficials.net by clicking the green "new user?" button on the left,  (for most of you, the next button you click will be the "I have NEVER BEEN registered" button.) Proceed to enter the information the site requests from you.

2) Once your GO account is created, follow the instructions in the attached pdf to register for the clinic you took and pay your fee. The clinic you are registering for won't actually have the date of your specific clinic on it -- don't worry about that. As long as its the 2017 FYSA grade 8 entry level clinic, its the right one. The fee should be $80.
note: the pdf has a class labeled RECERT as an example for clicking selecting a class -- you should be looking for the entry level clinic that I specified above instead.
After this, you should have a GO account in the AKSRA group and will have paid your fees.

Let me know if you have any questions!
